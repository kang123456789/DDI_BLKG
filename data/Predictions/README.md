# Predictions

Please download the probable DDIs as predicted by our model, from the following link:

- [AD](https://owncloud.skel.iit.demokritos.gr/index.php/s/u3YavqCYm2OQnQb)
- [LC](https://owncloud.skel.iit.demokritos.gr/index.php/s/k1jfjeskk9HuHJs)
- **(08/05/2020) ADDED**: [COVID-19](https://owncloud.skel.iit.demokritos.gr/index.php/s/VOVue7ltPYadWq9)

The links provide .csv files with the following 3 columns:

```sh
DrugBank_ID_1, DrugBank_ID_2, Probability
```

where the first two columns hold the DrugBank IDs for the two drugs of the pair and the *Probability* column a value between 0-1 denoting the probability for interaction (i.e. higher than *0.5* means this is probable DDI and the higher the better)

**DISCLAIMER**:

1. These are DDIs that were not validated in []DrugBank 5.0.3](https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/5-0-3).
2. These DDIs were predicted by our model as a research task and **should not be taken as medical advice** under any circumstance.
